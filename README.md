Weather Data Forecasting using Airflow

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simple yet powerful ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that automates the process of fetching weather data from the Open-Meteo API, transforming it using Python, orchestrating the workflow via Apache Airflow, and loading the processed data into a PostgreSQL database running inside a Docker container. The stored data can then be visualized or queried using DBeaver.
